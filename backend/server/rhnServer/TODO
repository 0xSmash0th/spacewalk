Few things are left to do on this rhnServer conversion:

- move the rpmdata stuff out of the rhnServer classes and into the
  rhnRPM top level module so we have a single place where we deal with
  rpm related stuff (database or not). There is no reason why rhnRPM
  could not behave pretty much the same way rhnChannel behaves

- same thing for package_path stuff, which is again only marginally
  related to the whole server concept. The rhnServer module should
  only be dealing with stuff clearly connected to the server (ie,
  hardware, packages, history, channel subscriptions and so forth). A
  possible problem here is dealing with the PackageNotFoundError
  exception, which is tested for in some places in the code.
