NOTE: very dated!!!!

These are things we need to still work on:

- deal with the OEM entitlement fields in
  registration.register_product()

- send mail on registration to org admins and the user registering the
  machine

- take a deep look at the registration numbers problem (and possibly
  just ignore them altogether until we figure out a proper way to
  register a number)

- create a script to mail out wake-up calls to people for servers
  being inactive

- document the server API

- column based preferences for
	rhnUserPrefs
	rhnServerPrefs
	- migrate rhnServerProperties into rhnServerPrefs
	rhnUserServerPrefs

- fix cgiwrap to easily find the integer corresponding to a string
  representation of tranfers/encodings.

- clean up auth_client/auth_proxy, looks like the declined return code is not
  needed. Maybe the same step as fixing rhnDefines.

- taw: need an rhn.conf.sample file simular to what we have in the proxy.
       - created and started... not nearly finished.
