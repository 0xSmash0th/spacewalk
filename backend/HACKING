Before running the backend unit tests you'll need to do the following:

 * Install python-nose.
 * export SPACEWALK_GIT=~/src/spacewalk
   * Adjust accordingly to point to the top level of your spacewalk git clone.
   * Probably wise to add to your ~/.bashrc or equivalent.

To run the pure unit tests (no disk/network/db access):

    nosetests test/unit/

To run the non-pure unit tests, you'll need a ~/.spacewalk-dev.conf.
See test/spacewalk-dev.conf.sample for a starting point.
