/**
 * ISOSet - structure for holding info about all ISOs for a given entity 
 * This is used for two kinds of ISOs, installation-ISOs and Spacewalk Content ISOs.  
 * Installation ISOs can be divided into binary and source ISOs.  Content ISOs can
 * be divided into Base and Incremental.  The division is done heuristically, based on 
 * three rules: 1) if "-source-" appears in the download--path, this must be a source ISO
 * else it is binary;  2) If "(Base" appears in the category this is a Base content ISO;
 * 3) If "(Incremental" appears in the category this is an Incremental Content ISO.
 * 
 * A given ISOSet will be either src/binary OR base/incr, never both.  This code takes
 * advantage of that context, knowing that the caller will "know" what kind of ISOSet 
 * they're dealing with.
 * 
 * If any of these assumptions changes, this code will break.  Ultimately, it would be
 * optimal if the DB content flagged ISOImages as one kind or another.
