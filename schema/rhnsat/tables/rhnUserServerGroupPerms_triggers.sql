-- Revision 1.1  2002/08/20 00:53:31  pjones
-- rhn/packages/rhn_email.pkb:
-- 	added "rebuild_table" procedure, it rebuilds rhnEmailableServers
-- 		completely
-- 	added "process updates" procedure, it processes the users and servers
-- 		listed in rhnEmailableServersUpdates
-- 	fixed some bugs in the generation routines
-- 	add routines to add users and servers to rhnEmailableServersUpdates
--
-- added lots of triggers.  now all we really need is a cronjob to do
-- 	rhn_email.process_updates()
-- every so often.
