TOOLS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

dogchow - Used to translate the common DDL to oracle|postgres specific
          DDL.

util/genmain.py - Used to generate the main.sql based on .deps files.


DEPENDENCY FILES (.deps)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Terms:
  namespace - A root directory.
              May be: (.|class|types|tables|views|procs|packages)
              where (.) represents the current namesapce.

  qname     - A qualified name.
              May be: [namespace/]basename[.ext].  When the namespace
              is not specified, the name is unqualified and resolved
              using the "path".  Using the extension is only necessary
              when more then (1) file exists in a given namespace with
              the same name but with different extensions.

Format:

  path = {namespace}([\s,]+{namespace})*

  {qname} :: {qname}([\s,]+{qname})*

Examples:

  path = . tables packages"

  rhnSharedChannelView :: rhnChannel procs/lookup_functions \
                          rhn_channel.pks

  Assuming the current namespace (or directory) is /views.
  The table dependency "rhnChannel" is unqualifed and would be searched
  for in the following order:
    1st. views/rhnChannel
    2nd. tables/rhnChannel
    3rd. packages/rhnChannel
  However, lookup_functions dependency is qualified by namespace so the
  path will not be used.
  The package header dependency "rhn_channel.pks" is unqualifed and but has
  an extension and would be searched for in the following order:
    1st. views/rhn_channel.pks
    2nd. tables/rhn_channel.pks
    3rd. packages/rhn_channel.pks

Lines may be joined by (\).


MAIN.SQL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The main.sql file is generated and references includes
the individual .sql, .pks, .pkb files within the directory
tree.  This file is generated by "utils/genmain.py and ordered 
based on .deps files.  This takes the place of the universal .sql
file.
