======================

FcntlLock provides a simple interface to fcntl(2) file locking,
allowing the caller to create a shared or exclusive lock on an
entire file.  The locks should work on an NFS-mounted volume or a
local filesystem.  All calls return 0 on success, -1 on failure with
$! set to the specific error.
