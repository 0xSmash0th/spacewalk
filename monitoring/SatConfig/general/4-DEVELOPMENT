The "SysV" system defines a framework within which one can
write steps that will execute during the startup of a 
machine.  From a deveopers perspective, there are three
major types of steps:

SysVStep: This is the most basic type of step and is in fact
the superclass of the other types.  It defines a protocol for
starting, stopping, and statusing behavior as well as facilities
for running shell commands and debugging.

GogoSysVStep: This specialized step understands how to use
and communicate with gogo.pl (ProgAGoGo).  In many cases 
authoring this type of step is mostly a matter of putting
entries in np-config.

MacroSysVStep: This specialized step provides facilities
that allow it to launch other steps (of any type, including
MacroSysVStep).  This is useful when startup behavior is 
conditioned on some state (like a flag file or hardware situation).
