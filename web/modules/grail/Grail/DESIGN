Request comes in.

Grail core is told to load N applications.  Instances them.

Determines frame to render.  Finds canvases in frames.  Instances them.

Grail renders each canvas.

Canvas finds components inside of it (learned from config data passed
from grail core).  Instances them, renders in appropriate mode.

Can canvases contain other canvases?

--

Components:
 x Must have default mode
 x Can have other modes
 x Can be full-canvas or partial-canvas
 x Can have special "configure" mode
 x Can render and can receive traps

Canvases:
 x ISA component?
 x Has different types; type determines component view mode

Frames:
 x virtual pages; contain Canvases
 x accessed like file system (see URLs below)

URLs:
 x /grail/(framename)/(params to canvas renderers)
 x examples:
  - /grail/rhn/personal/configure
  - /grail/rhn/configure
  - /grail/rhn/sysdir
  - /grail/rhn/sysdir/edit
 x strip /grail; next goes to frame.  rest is for canvases and
   components to use as they see fit  use pathinfo and not formvars.
