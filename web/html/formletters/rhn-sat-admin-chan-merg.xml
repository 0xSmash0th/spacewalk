RHN Satellite Special Announcement, January 2005

On February 1, 2005, the Red Hat Network team will be making some changes to
our services. These changes involve the structure of the Red Hat Enterprise
Linux Channels, giving all Red Hat customers significantly greater choice in
processor architectures by combining access to 32- and 64-bit architectures
under a single subscription. Because we feel this presents a significant value
we have chosen to implement this change in such a way as to grant this
additional access to all of our Satellite customers. 

In order to make this change with a minimum risk of disrupting the
management capabilities of existing deployed RHN Satellite installations
we have chosen a solution which requires action at the customer side for
this change to take place.

Following the RHN scheduled production outage all existing Satellite
systems will be unable to sync content until remedial actions are taken
on the Satellite. The high-level process for reenabling sync
capabilities is:

1. generate and validate a Satellite backup (recommended)
2. run up2date on the Satellite to receive the updated packages
3. restart the Satellite service and UI
4. run satellite-sync

Upon completion of this process the Satellite will have downloaded a new
entitlement certificate with the necessary changes along with deploying
additional packages to support the improved synchronization protocol.

If you have any questions regarding this transition, please feel free to
contact your Red Hat Technical Representative. 

A *draft* Red Hat Knowledge Base article exists to discuss this change in
detail and can be found at: http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_49_4893.shtm
