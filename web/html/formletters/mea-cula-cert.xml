The certificate used by up2date and rhn_register to communicate with the
Red Hat Network reached its end of life on August 28th 2003.  Users
attempting to connect to Red Hat Network will see SSL connection or
certificate verification failures.

New versions of the up2date and rhn_register clients are now available
which are required for continued access to Red Hat Network.

       https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003-268.html

New versions of the up2date client that contain the new certificate are
immediately available for download at:
