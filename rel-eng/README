Usage:
    make tag-release	Bump version of the package and tag the commit.

    make tag-minor-release	Bump release of the package and tag the commit.

	After running make tag-release or tag-minor-release, the tag is
	only in your local repository. Review the changes
	(try: gitk --all &) and then push the commit and the new tag to
	the upstream repository, or make srpm will use the old tag (or
	not work at all):

	git push
	git push ssh://git.fedorahosted.org/git/spacewalk.git/ tag <the-tag>

    make srpm		Build .src.rpm from latest tagged release of the
			package. The tag has to be not only in the local
			repository but also in the upstream repo.

    make test-srpm      Packs source from local HEAD and builds srpm locally.
			You can then rpmbuild it on your machine or
			elsewhere. The package has git commit SHA1 in its
			Release. The .src.rpm will be left in your working
			directory.

    make test-rpm       Packs source from local HEAD and builds both srpm
			and binary rpm locally. The package has git commit
			SHA1 in its Release. The .src.rpm will be left in
			your working directory, the .rpm(s) in some noarch
			or arch subdirectories.

The Makefile in package's directory should specify NAME and SPECFILE, and
then include this Makefile, via

	include .../rel-eng/Makefile

If you do not want the directory to be packed to .tar.gz for packages where
we are not the upstream, specify

	NO_TAR_GZ = 1

in the Makefile. In that case, you need to have that upstream's .tar.gz in
the repository already.
