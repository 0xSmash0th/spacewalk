Usage:
    make test-srpm      Packs source from local HEAD and builds srpm
			locally. You can then rpmbuild it on your
			machine or elsewhere. The package has git
			commit SHA1 in its Release. The .src.rpm will
			be left in your working directory.

    make test-rpm       Packs source from local HEAD and builds both
			srpm and binary rpm locally. The package has
			git commit SHA1 in its Release. The .src.rpm
			will be left in your working directory, the
			.rpm(s) in some noarch or arch subdirectories.

The Makefile in package's directory should specify NAME and SPECFILE,
and then include this Makefile, via

	include .../rel-eng/Makefile

If you do not want the directory to be packed to .tar.gz for packages
where we are not the upstream, specify

	NO_TAR_GZ = 1

in the Makefile. In that case, you need to have that upstream's .tar.gz
in the repository already.
