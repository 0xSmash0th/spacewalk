Usage:
    make test-srpm      Packs source and builds srpm locally. You can then
                        which you can then rpmbuild it on your machine or
                        elsewhere.

    make test-rpm       Packs source and builds both srpm and binary
			rpm locally.

The Makefile in package's directory should specify NAME and SPECFILE,
and then include this Makefile.git.

If you want the git tree (of the HEAD commit) to be made into tar.gz
(which you do for projects / directories where we are the upstream and
do not work against some well known upstream tar.gz release), define
DO_TAR_GZ variable in your Makefile. Two values are supported:

    DO_TAR_GZ := git-tree-sha1
        will name the tar.gz file and the directory within it with
        $(NAME)-git-r$(SHA1 of the HEAD commit); you have to extract this
        name in your .spec file from SOURCE0 and pass it to %setup -n.

    DO_TAR_GZ := version
        name the tar.gz file and the directory within it with
        $(NAME)-$(VERSION)
