= OVERVIEW OF SPACEWALK BRANCHES =

Right now we branch Spacewalk as a single unit. This is a lot less
confusing than separate branches for web, backend, java, etc.

== CURRENT RELEASES ==

master - will become the Spacewalk 0.3 release.

RELEASE-0.2 - the Spacewalk 0.2 release

TRACKING  |               |
BUGZILLA  | TARGET        |
ALIAS     | RELEASE       | BRANCHES
----------+---------------+--------------
space02   | Spacewalk 0.2 | RELEASE-0.2
space03   | Spacewalk 0.3 | master

When checking in fixes, check changes into master and the appropriate
branch(es) for the target release, if any.  For example, if you fix
a bug in RELEASE-0.2 it *must* be added to master as well.

This does not apply to development branches, which will get merged
back into master once master is released.
