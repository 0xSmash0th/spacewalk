rhn-clone-errata.py : This handles pulling errata from RHN and
publishing them in my "official" RHEL channels.  Typical usage for me:

rhn-clone-errata.py -s localhost -l <username> -p <password> \
  --src-channel=rhel-x86_64-server-5 \
  -b YYYYMMDD -e YYYYMMDD -u

spw-clone-errata.py : This handles cloning the errata I have in my
"official" channels into cloned "production" channels.  This helps me do
proper release management of errata for my org.  Typical usage:

spw-clone-errata.py -s localhost -l <username> -p <password> -c
rhel-i386-server-prod-4-7 -e 20080724

(NOTE: This end-date corresponds to the release of RHEL 4.7.  This
allows me to clone to production channels all errata up to that
release.. more or less.)

These will eventually be thrown together into one script... but I'm
still actively developing and will get there eventually.  I've also been
lazy about handling credentials... so you'll find these sanitized for my
protection.
