Create channel to update level
 	by Justin Sherrill (jsherril@redhat.com)

This script can create a channel to a specific update level (i.e. RHEL4u3) or upgrade an existing channel to a higher update level on an RHN Satellite.

For help, simply run ./create-channel-update --help

In addition to the script, you should find in this directory:
data/   - Data files for all of the update releases.
README  - This file


Changelog:

03/06/09 - 2.0-beta
- Rewrite in python, supporting command line arguments.  
- Now support clearing channel (with --clear) before pushing packages
- Can now specify the src channel if you don't want to the script to figure it out
- Can now just specify the data file instead of version, release, arch, etc..
- Can specify the parent channel to create a child (if channel doesn't exist)

11/21/08 - 1.5
- Added support for Extras and Supplementary channels

9/17/08 - 1.4
- Improved speed by grouping package additions instead of doing them one at a time.  If you start getting 502 proxy errors, try reducing the size of $packGroupSize at the top of the script

- Added RHEL 5.2 and 4.7 data files

12/14/07 - 1.2
-Added RHEL 5 support (Including VT, Cluster, etc..), gold update level support, and package count indicator.  Couple of fixes as well (RHEL 3,4 Desktop actually works!).
